Projectile Simulator



Overview
The Projectile Simulator app allows users to simulate the trajectories of various projectiles by inputting different angles and speeds. This can be useful for educational purposes and for understanding basic physics principles related to projectile motion.

Features

Simulate Your Own Projectile: Input custom angle and speed to see the projectile's trajectory.
Famous Projectiles: Explore predefined scenarios like Galileo's Cannonball Drop and Newton's Apple.
Support: Easily contact support via phone or email.

Installation
Download the APK: Obtain the APK file from the provided source.
Install the App:
Transfer the APK file to your Android device.

Simulation Screen


Input Fields:

Enter Angle (degrees): Input the angle at which the projectile is launched.
Enter Speed (m/s): Input the speed of the projectile.

Start Simulation:

Tap the "Start Simulation" button to view the trajectory of the projectile based on the entered angle and speed.
Trajectory Visualization:

The trajectory of the projectile will be displayed on the screen. The simulation considers the effects of gravity on the projectileâ€™s motion.

Sound Effect:

When the "Start Simulation" button is pressed, a gunshot sound effect will play, enhancing the simulation experience.

Troubleshooting
App Crashes: Ensure your device meets the minimum system requirements. Restart your device and try again.
Simulation Not Working: Double-check the input values for the angle and speed. Ensure they are valid numbers.
